# Diophantine-Existence
Determines whether a bivariate polynomial Diophantine equation has integer solutions
Can run very slowly depending upon the polynomial which is input. 

Based upon the papers "On the Diophantine Equation y^2 = x^3 + 7" and "The Existence of Solutions to the Diophantine Equation
f(x,y) = 0" which may be accessed at this link: https://sites.google.com/site/operakarl/papers
